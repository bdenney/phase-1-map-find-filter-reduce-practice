# Extra Practice for Find, Filter, Map

## This will work differently from a lab! Just print out your results in console.log()!

---
- Create a function called `firstHalloweenAfter` that takes in year as an argument and returns the first Halloween movie released on or after that year. If no movie is found, return the ominous string "He will return...". You **must** use `array.find()`!

- Create a function called `findMichael` that returns an array of the movies in `HALLOWEEN_MOVIES` that contain the string `Michael Myers`. You **must** use `array.filter()`!

- Create a function called `newHalloweenMovies` that takes one argument called that is a year. Return an array of all movies that were released **after** the given year. You **must** use `array.filter()`!

- Create a function called `dontCountMichael` that returns the count of movies that **do not** have the string `Michael Myers` in the name. You **must** use `array.reduce()`!

- Create a function called `averageYear` that returns the average of the year of all movies in `HALLOWEEN_MOVIES`. You **must** use `array.reduce()`!

- Create a function called `theLastWord` that returns the last word of each movie in `HALLOWEEN_MOVIES`. You **must** use `array.map()`!
